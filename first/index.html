    <p>Dean exhaled roughly, shoving his hands further into his 
      jacket pockets as he strode down the dark, icy street. An early 
      snowfall had turned to slush, and thick brown wedges of crisped mud 
      lay stacked at the side of porches and next to the curb. A car drew 
      up to the sidewalk just in front of Dean as he walked, and a family 
      piled out, laughing and pushing each other whilst the exhaust 
      spewed out hot, grey smoke into the biting air.
